==========

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ccnmtl/tobaccocessation.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Tobacco Cessation is an educational website that provides students in the Columbia College of Dental Medicine with multimedia learning modules on strategies designed to assist clinicians in delivering and supporting effective treatments for tobacco use and dependence. The site offers a framework for self-study lessons and activities, including immediate-response quizzes, treatment activities, four virtual patients, and demonstrative videos, which students are assigned to review before attending a required tobacco cessation seminar. After students complete the online modules independently and learn the material by working through the online scenarios, they are then asked to role-play potential encounters during the seminar and reflect on their experience.
